The following issues were address one by one.

1. Do the height and weight columns have the appropriate data types?

2. Can you separate the joined column into year, month and day column?

3. Can you clean and transform the value, wage and release clause columns into columns of integers?

4. How can you remove the newline characters from the Hits column?

5. Can you separate the Team & Contract column into separate Team and Contract columns?
